### Abstract: 
In this fast-paced tutorial we will start with an overview of how Linux works.
We'll review some of the interesting history of UNIX and why some things exist.
We'll cover all the basics before moving on to how to approach troubleshooting
in a systematic fashion. Armed with a method, we'll look at some examples and
the tools that are useful for finding the sources of problems.


Thomas started working with UNIX while at University in Vancouver. He switched
from IRIX/Solaris to Linux in the early 90s and has been a fan since then. He's
written a few books on Puppet as well as Linux. He lives and works in Seattle
and in Pacific Northwest tradition is an avid Mountain Biker and Hiker.
