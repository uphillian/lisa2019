### Abstract: 
In this fast-paced tutorial we will start with an overview of how Linux works.
We'll review some of the interesting history of UNIX and why some things exist.
We'll cover all the basics before moving on to how to approach troubleshooting
in a systematic fashion. Armed with a method, we'll look at some examples and
the tools that are useful for finding the sources of problems.
